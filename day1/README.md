# DSA-with-JavaScript


Notes

1) When we want the quotient in the answer, we use the division operator (/). We also use the method Math.floor() to get the whole number part of the result.

2) When we want the remainder in the answer, we use the modulo operator (%).


# Unary Operator

++{(pre,post)increment}
--{(pre,post)decrement}
